# "Ship Shootin'" - By Abe Doughty

This is a spaceship shooter game in the style of 80's arcade games.
You are the captain of a starship tasked with defending a space station on
the edge of explored space. Who's out there with you? Aliens. That's who.
And they want to blow up your spot.

Use your ship's laser cannons and fight your way through waves of enemy alien ships.
If you need backup, call for aid from starbase!
Don't let the hostile aliens breach your defensive line, or all will be lost!
How long can you survive?

Instructions:
1) Use the arrow keys to steer the ship
2) Use 'F' to fire your blasters
3) If you need a hand, use 'C' to call for aid and a friendly squadron will clear out the
    opposite side of the map.
4) Periodically the level will increase, and the alien ships will become faster
5) You have limited squadron charges, but you will replenish one at the end of every level.
6) If you hit a ship, you lose a life. If you allow an alien to pass, you lose a life.
7) After five lives have been lost, game over!
8) If you set a high score you will be prompted to enter your name with the on-screen keyboard.

I have only run this game on MacOS.
All code is written entirely by me with the exception of some code from class which is cited in the comments
where applicable.
